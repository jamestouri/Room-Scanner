# Room-Scanner
Raspberry Pi takes 360 degree view and clicks data points to understand its environment.  Collaborative Project from James Touri and Alex Henderson

The room scanner takes data from itâ€™s surroundings with a 1D laser to build a simulated environment for a robot to understand landmarks and move around with Gaussian Probability for localization solutions. 

## What it does
The room scanner is a device that is powered by a raspberry pi and uses a LaserPing to scan distances of the objects close by.  It uses a 1D signal and gives a voltage as a reading to describe how many volts it has to exert to reach an object.  The distances are then converted to X and Y coordinates based on the voltage and the milliseconds calculated to find number of degrees.

## Building the Device

Powered and run by a Raspberry Pi 3, a 3d printed rotary table turns via a geared DC can motor. The motor will be run via a 11.1v lipoly battery and the pi will be run using a 7.4v lipoly battery and a 5v switching regulator. We are utilizing a Laser PING IR rangefinder that we be switched from analog to digital signal via a Arduino nano.

We will be running the motor at 10V with a voltage regulator to ensure the motor stays at 10V and constant speed (if this proves to be a problem we will look into a geared motor with an encoder and mosfet).

## Converting the data points from the voltage

The data points were received in voltages and milliseconds.  It took approximately 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) to go in a full rotation, and we recorded the time it received a certain voltage.  From there we converted the time it took to attain that voltage and attained the degrees.  You can see the function more in depth from the data_process.py, DistanceSensor Class.


From there we plot them on a X and Y plane to create an environment for the robot to maneuver around it. In the robot.py file, we have a robot class for sensing where it is based on the landmarks from the voltages provided with random noise. 


## Next steps

We have not added random noise to the raspberry pi device as it rotates in a circle, for which we will. We would also like to add the ability for the robot to get from point A to B with that is optimal with and goes around landmarks correctly.
